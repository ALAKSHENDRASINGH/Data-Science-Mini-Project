### **Project Title:**  
**District Wise SLL Crime Statistics in Collab with Educational Performance**

---

### **Overview**
This project explores the relationship between educational performance and crime trends across Indian districts using data-driven analysis.  
It integrates two major datasets — **National Achievement Survey (NAS)** (2017–2021) and **District-wise Special & Local Laws (SLL) Crimes** — to identify patterns, correlations, and socio-educational insights.

The objective is to analyze how district-level education outcomes relate to local crime rates, using advanced statistical methods and machine learning for clustering and predictive modeling.

### **Key Features**
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and integration of NAS and NCRB datasets.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify regional patterns and performance variations.  
- Correlation and regression analysis to measure education–crime relationships.  
- Machine learning models (K-Means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for performance prediction.  
- Visualization of district-level disparities and temporal trends (2017–2021).  
- Integration of insights into an interactive **Streamlit** application.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Languages:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit  
- **Data Sources:** NDAP (NAS dataset), NCRB (Crime Statistics)
